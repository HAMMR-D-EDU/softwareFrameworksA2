## Architecture Overview

```
User → Angular (Socket.IO client) → Socket.IO Server → MongoDB
         ↓ RxJS Observables              ↓ Rooms
         ↓ Real-time updates             ↓ Broadcast
         ↓                               ↓

## Key Technologies

- **MongoDB** - Native driver, async/await
- **Socket.IO** - WebSocket real-time communication  
- **RxJS** - Observable streams for reactive updates
- **Formidable** - File upload handling
- **Angular** - Standalone components
- **ES6 Modules** - import/export throughout

---

## Troubleshooting

**Chat not loading?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Socket.IO connected (look for "✓ Connected to Socket.IO" in console)

**Messages not sending?**
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check network tab for WebSocket connection
- Verify server is running

**Images not uploading?**
- Check file size (< 5MB)
- Verify `userimages/` folder exists in server
- Check server logs for errors
